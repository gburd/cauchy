Cauchy-based Reed-Solomon codes

To understand the theory behind these codes, see the paper titled An XOR-Based Erasure-Resilient Coding Scheme (237K). These erasure codes are based on traditional Reed-Solomon codes, and are implemented in a way that makes them run reasonably fast using a reasonable amount of memory. They were developed in 1993-1994 for use in the PET project at ICSI, and are fast enough to run on real-time on small lengths.
